# Online Music Store SQL Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project is designed to introduce SQL database querying while analyzing a hypothetical dataset from an online music store.

## Goals
- Gain practical experience in SQL querying
- Analyze the music store dataset to derive meaningful insights
- Answer key business questions to aid decision-making

## Dataset
The dataset provided contains information about the store's playlists, tracks, customers, and more. It includes various tables such as `playlist`, `track`, `customer`, `invoice`, etc., each capturing different aspects of the store's operations.

## Analysis

- What are the top-selling tracks and albums?
- Which genres are most popular among customers?
- Who is the senior most employee based on job title?
- And more!

## Database and Tools
- Postgre SQL
- PgAdmin4

## Usage
1. Execute the queries individually based on your analysis requirements.
2. Explore the results for valuable insights into genres, tracks and trends.
